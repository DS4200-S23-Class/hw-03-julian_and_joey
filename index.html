                <p class="bold">Marks:</p><ul>
                    <li>Areas (For both the bar above the map of the US, and the map of the US)</li>
                    <li>Points (For the statewide and district electoral votes)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bold">Channels:</p><ul>
                    <li>Color- The attribute color is representing if the state voted for the republican or 
                        democratic candidate. This is a great choice, because naturally, people associate a state to 
                        be colored red if it leans right politically, and blue if it leans left.</li>
                    <li>Position- The position attribute represents where the state is geographically
                        located. When representing geographical data, is it often favored to have the channel 
                        position. This is because one can reference the geographical area to others around it
                        quite easily.</li>
                    <li>Length- The length of the statewide and district electoral votes represents how many
                        statewide and district the two states have. If the length of red boxes for Nebraska's
                        district votes is longer, than we can infer there were more district votes that were
                        for the republican candidate in Nebraska. This is a solid choice, as length is a great
                        method to analyze the magnitude, the issue with this aspect of the visualization is more
                        the random placement of a red point between two points.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bold">Colormap(s):</p><ul>
                    <li>Divergent: The divergent colormap of red and blue represents the attribute of which party the
                        state voted. Although there are only two colors, we can assume this graph is divergent, because
                        people often refer to the political spectrum when looking at voting data. For instance, light blue
                        would represent a moderate democratic state, wheras a darker blue would represent a radical democratic
                        state.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="text2">
                <p class="bold">Mark:</p><ul>
                    <li>Points</ul></li>
                <p class="bold">Channels:</p><ul>
                <li>Color- The color of each point represents the scoring value for each hit. This is a great way to
                    show the value of index, because the more orange the hue, the better the hit. Alternatively, the more
                    purple hue in a point, the worse the point fell on the LWTS scale.</li>
                <li>Position (Both)- The position of the point is very important. The higher the point is on the graph, the higher
                    angle the ball was it. The farther right the point is located on the graph, the more exit velocity the ball
                    had. Thus position is representing both the exit velocity of the ball and the launch angle attributes. This is a 
                    very good choice for a channel, because the graph can be more simple by reprsenting two attributes simulteously.
                    If we were to represent velocity by area and angle by shape, this graph would become extremely confusing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="bold">Colormap(s):</p><ul>
                    <li>Divergent: The divergent colormap of yellow and purple respresents the attribute of scoring value. This is 
                        not the best use of a colormap. Hits that are colored purple aren't negative scoring hits. They can still 
                        represent a positive value, they are just below the average. Perhaps a sequential colormap would be a more
                        proper colormap given we are working with scoring value data.
                     
                </ul>
                <div class="text3">
                    <p class="bold">Mark:</p><ul>
                        <li>Lines</ul></li>
                    <p class="bold">Channels:</p><ul>
                    <li>Color- The color hue of the lines represents the attribute region. We think color hue was a good choice, because
                        color is one of the main ways to separate categorical data.
                    </li>
                    <li>Position (Both)- The position of the line is very important. The height of the line represents the biodiversity
                        index (how biologically diverse the region is), the width of the line simply represents time. (1970-2018) 
                        This is a good choice because size channels could confuse the viewer, and shape would be redundant with color,
                        and thus would have no added benefit.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bold">Colormap(s):</p><ul>
                        <li>
                            Categorical- The colors represent the attribute region. The regions have no inherent relation to each other,
                            so it would not make sense to use a sequential or divergent colormap.
